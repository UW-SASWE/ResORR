# ResORR - Reservoir Operations driven River Regulation

ResORR is a scalable, minimally parameterized model to estimate regulation of rivers due to upstream reservoir operations primarily using satellite observations of reservoir dynamcis. It is designed to work within the Reservoir Assessment Tool (RAT) framework, and can be easily initialized and run using an existing setup of [RAT 3.0](https://rat-satellitedams.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The model is packaged as a python module and can be imported in jupyter notebooks or python scripts for further analysis. The next section describes how to use the model.
